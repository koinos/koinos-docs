# System calls
System calls are how requests to the Koinos Blockchain Framework are made. Each system call provides important functionality to be utilized from smart contracts or other parts of the framework.

Each system call has its base functionality implemented natively in a function known as a "thunk". What differentiates a system call from its thunk, is that the system call can have its functionality overridden by a special type of smart contract known as a "system contract".

Detailed information regarding the arguments and return values of system calls are defined as protocol buffer messages in the [Koinos Proto](https://github.com/koinos/koinos-proto/blob/master/koinos/chain/system_calls.proto) repository.

## Overriding system calls
While any system call can be overridden by a contract that simply calls the underlying thunk, the underlying functionality of some of them cannot be reproduced in the KVM. **Table 2** lists system calls which cannot be fully replaced by an override, and the reason it cannot be overridden.

_**Table 2.** System calls which cannot be overridden_

|System Call|Reason|
|---|---|
|`apply_block`|Requires access to the execution context|
|`apply_set_system_call_operation`|Requires call to `get_transaction`|
|`apply_set_system_contract_operation`|Requires call to `get_transaction`|
|`apply_transaction`|Requires state access|
|`call`|Requires stack frame access|
|`event`|Requires event recorder access|
|`exit`|Would cause infinite recursion|
|`get_caller`|Requires stack frame access and caller access on execution environment|
|`get_arguments`|Requires access to contract call arguments on execution environment|
|`get_contract_id`|Requires access to contract id on execution environment|
|`get_head_info`|Requires state access|
|`get_last_irreversible_block`|Requires state access|
|`get_next_object`|Requires state access|
|`get_object`|Requires state access|
|`get_prev_object`|Requires state access|
|`put_object`|Requires state access|

## Thunks
Ultimately system calls you make ends up manipulating native code. The native functions that get invoked are known as thunks. When the Koinos blockchain launched all system calls were a light translation layer that directly mapped to thunks implemented in C++. While system calls can be implemented via smart contract or native code, thunks only exist as native C++ implementations.

There are several reasons for implementing functionality via thunks. Some system calls require low level access and can only be implemented natively. As part of the Koinos Blockchain Framework design, we attempt to minimize these cases in order to facilitate forkless upgrades. Another reason to implement functionality via thunks is performance. It will always be more efficient to execute code natively than to run bytecode in the Koinos Virtual Machine. This results in lower the mana costs which improves the user experience.

System contracts have unique abilities when compared to user contracts. Aside from accessing kernel space, system contracts can call thunks directly. This makes it possible to alter the behavior of a system call that requires calling a thunk with pre and post processing in the KVM.

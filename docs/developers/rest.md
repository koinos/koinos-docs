# REST API
The REST API provided by Koinos offers developers a convenient and straightforward way to interact with the blockchain using standard HTTP methods. This API simplifies integration and development by abstracting complex blockchain interactions into intuitive HTTP endpoints, making it accessible to a wider audience of developers who are familiar with web technologies. With the REST API, developers can easily query blockchain data, submit transactions, and interact with smart contracts without the need for specialized blockchain knowledge, streamlining the development process for decentralized applications (dApps) on the Koinos platform.

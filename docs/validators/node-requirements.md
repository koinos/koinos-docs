- 16 GB RAM
- 100 GB free disk space (As of May 2024, 18 GB is required, but the amount is constantly growing)

## Note on disk space
As of May 2024, only 18 GB of disk space is required. However, due the every growing nature of blockchains, more and more disk space will be needed to run a node. It is recommended that you have plenty of free space to allow for that growth without having to constantly monitor your node.

If you are running additional microservices, specifically those enabled with the API profile, your disk usage will be more to accommodate for the additional data tracked by those microservices. As of May 2024, running with the optional API microservices requires 30 GB total (12 GB more than the minimal configuration) and will grow at a faster rate.

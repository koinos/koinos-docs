# REST
The Koinos REST API provides a clean and simple way of interacting with the Koinos blockchain using standard HTTP methods. The API automatically handles de/serializations when interacting with smart contracts. It can also help with preparing and submitting a transaction.

You can view the [REST documentation](../developers/rest.md) to learn more.

The REST API is available on [Koinos**Pro**](https://koinos.pro). You can sign up for a free account and begin working with the REST API immediately. 

You can also access the REST API by running your own Koinos node. Learn how to run a Koinos node [here](../validators/guides/running-a-node.md). To enable the REST API, you will need to have `rest`, `api`, or `all` set in your `COMPOSE_PROFILES`.

# Docker Compose profiles
Docker Compose profiles allow embedded different configurations within a single compose file. The Koinos node comes with several compose profiles configured that quickly enable common configurations. For more information on Docker Compose profiles, please read the official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/profiles/).

To enable a compose profile you can pass it in with the `--profile` option (e.g. `docker compose --profile jsonrpc up`), or by setting the `COMPOSE_PROFILES` environment variable in the shell or in `.env`. We recommend setting `COMPOSE_PROFILES` in `.env` so that you do not need to remember to add `--profile` to every compose command. For this reason, there is already a place to set `COMPOSE_PROFILES` in the provided `.env` example.

You can run additional microservices or set common configurations by enabled on, or more, of the following profiles:

| `jsonrpc`              | Enables JSON-RPC API handling. |
| `grpc`                 | Enables gRPC API handling. |
| `transaction_store`    | Enables transaction history tracking. |
| `contract_meta_store`  | Enables service of contract ABIs. |
| `account_history`      | Enables account history tracking. |
| `api`                  | Enables API related microservices (`jsonrpc`, `grpc`, `transaction_store`, `contract_meta_store`, and `account_history`). |
| `all`                  | Enables all microservices. |

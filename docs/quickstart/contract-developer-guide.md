# Contract developer guide

## Official SDKs

There are currently two officially supported SDKs for building Koinos contracts: AssemblyScript and C++

## AssemblyScript SDK

### Creating new contracts with the Assemblyscript SDK

To get started, you will need to clone the `koinos-contracts-as` repository, which contains a template contract.

```console
git clone https://github.com/koinos/koinos-contracts-as.git
```

### Modifying the template contract

The code for you endpoints is in `assembly/Template.ts`. Feel free to rename this file to reflect your contract, as well as other files.

Protobuf types including the endpoint argument and return types are contained in `assembly/proto`, in files with the `.proto` extension.

### Building the contract

Yarn is used to build the contract. From the base directory:

```console
yarn install
yarn build:release
```

The contracts's binary is now available at `build/contract.wasm`, and the ABI is now available at `abi/<contract-name>.abi`.

## C++ SDK

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will install the Koinos C++ SDK as well as its dependencies to `~/opt`. This is just a suggestion
and will work if you decide another location is more appropriate for you.

### Retrieving dependencies

The Koinos C++ SDK has three dependencies.
- Protobuf 3.17.3
- WASI SDK 12.0
- EmbeddedProto

#### Protocol buffers

First, we will install the Protobuf dependency. While it is possible to install this via a package manager such as Homebrew or Aptitude,
we will build the dependency from source so that we may target the exact version of Protobuf required by the C++ SDK without regard to version available in
your preferred pacakage manager.

```console
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf.git
$ cd protobuf
$ git checkout v3.17.3
$ mkdir _build
$ cd _build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/opt/protobuf-3.17.3 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../cmake
$ make -j install
```

#### WASI SDK

Because WASI SDK provides adequate release packages on GitHub, we will simply grab the package for our operating system and extract it to the correct
location.

##### macOS
```console
$ wget https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-12/wasi-sdk-12.0-macos.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf wasi-sdk-12.0-macos.tar.gz -C ~/opt
```

##### Linux
```console
$ wget https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-12/wasi-sdk-12.0-linux.tar.gz -C ~/opt2
$ tar -xvf wasi-sdk-12.0-linux.tar.gz -C ~/opt
```

#### EmbeddedProto

We will only need to clone this repository. We leverage the `protoc` plugin provided by this repository for serialization within the virtual machine.

```console
$ cd ~/opt
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/koinos/EmbeddedProto.git
```

### Building the C++ SDK

In order to build Koinos smart contracts you must first install the Koinos C++ SDK. Navigate to the [Koinos C++ SDK](https://github.com/koinos/koinos-sdk-cpp)
and clone the repository.

The C++ SDK relies on WASI SDK in order to build. We let the project know the location of WASI SDK using the environment variable `KOINOS_WASI_SDK_ROOT`.

```console
$ export KOINOS_WASI_SDK_ROOT=~/opt/wasi-sdk-12.0
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/koinos/koinos-sdk-cpp.git
$ cd koinos-sdk-cpp
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/opt/koinos-sdk-cpp ..
$ make -j install
```

## Using the Koinos C++ SDK

You are now prepared to compile Koinos smart contracts. Koinos smart contracts are built using the CMake build system. Using the provided
CMake toolchain file, along with a few environment variables, you can now build contracts.

Assuming you have placed the Koinos C++ SDK and the associated dependencies in `~/opt`, you can set the necessary environment variables as follows:

```console
$ export KOINOS_WASI_SDK_ROOT=~/opt/wasi-sdk-12.0
$ export KOINOS_PROTOBUF_ROOT=~/opt/protobuf-3.17.3
$ export KOINOS_EMBEDDED_PROTO_ROOT=~/opt/EmbeddedProto
$ export KOINOS_SDK_ROOT=~/opt/koinos-sdk-cpp
```

You are now ready to configure your smart contract project. From your project root directory, use the provided toolchain file and build:

```console
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${KOINOS_SDK_ROOT}/cmake/koinos-wasm-toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make -j
```

There is a skeleton cmake project in [Koinos Contract Examples](https://github.com/koinos/koinos-contract-examples) that you can use for your own smart contracts.

After building your smart contract you will find two important artifacts in your build directory.
- The WASM binary (`*.wasm`)
- A type descriptor file (`*.pb`)

At the moment, we must manually create an Application Binary Interface (ABI) file to use with `koinos-cli`. This will require utilizing the type descriptor file. For more information on how that file is structured see the [Contract ABI](../architecture/contract-abi.md) documentation.

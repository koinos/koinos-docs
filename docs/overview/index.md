    To begin, let's delve into the basics of blockchain technology. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure and transparent manner. Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating an immutable record of all transactions.

    ---

    Tokenomics refers to the economic model and dynamics surrounding the native coin of the Koinos blockchain. The Koinos coin serves various purposes within the ecosystem, including access to resources, network governance, and incentivizing participation.

    ---

    Koinos introduces a unique consensus mechanism known as proof-of-burn. This innovative approach involves burning tokens to validate transactions and secure the network. By sacrificing tokens through burning, participants demonstrate their commitment to the network's integrity and consensus.

    ---

    Mana is a key concept in the Koinos ecosystem, representing the access to resources within the network. Through the accumulation of KOIN, which contain mana, users can perform transactions on the network without transaction fees.

    ---

    Smart contracts play a crucial role in the functionality of the Koinos blockchain. These self-executing contracts are written in code and automatically enforce the terms of an agreement when predefined conditions are met. Smart contracts enable a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) to be built on the Koinos platform.

    ---

    Blockchain governance refers to the processes and structures put in place to manage and regulate decentralized blockchain networks. It encompasses decision-making mechanisms, protocol upgrades, consensus mechanisms, and dispute resolution mechanisms within the blockchain ecosystem.

# NFT
Welcome to the guide on launching an NFT collection using the Koinos Contract Standard ([KCS-2](https://github.com/koinos/koinos-contract-standards/blob/master/KCSs/kcs-2.md)). Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a specific item, typically stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are interchangeable and have the same value, NFTs are indivisible and each has distinct properties that set it apart from others. They are commonly used to buy and sell digital art, collectibles, music, virtual real estate, and other digital items, providing creators with a way to monetize their work while ensuring its uniqueness and provenance.

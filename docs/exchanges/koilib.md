# Koilib
Koilib is a Javascript library for interacting with Koinos. It is available via npm or can be included directly in the browser. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koilib).

Koilib requires a Koinos JSON-RPC endpoint to connect to.

You can access the JSON-RPC API on [Koinos**Pro**](https://koinos.pro). You can sign up for a free account and begin working with the JSON-RPC API immediately.

`https://api.koinos.io` is a free, rate-limited, public API endpoint that you can also use.

Lastly, you can also access the JSON-RPC API by running your own Koinos node. Learn how to run a Koinos node [here](../validators/guides/running-a-node.md). To enable the JSON-RPC API, you will need to have `jsonrpc`, `api`, or `all` set in your `COMPOSE_PROFILES`.
